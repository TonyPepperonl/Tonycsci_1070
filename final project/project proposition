1. I plan to work alone for this project
2. I plan on using this data set on Student Performance

Null hypothesis: In the student performance data set, The of education of student's parents, their ethnicity, or gender will have any influence on their perfromance
Alternative hypothesis: In the student performance data set we will see that the level of education of student's parents, their ethnicity, and gender will have an impact on their performance.
The model that I will use for this data set is most likely something that works well with continuous data, for example a Multiple Linear Regression model.
