1. I plan to work alone for this project
2. I plan on using this data set on Student Performance

Null hypothesis: In the student performance data set, I do not think that whether or not a student has had lunch will have any affect on their performance 
Alternative hypothesis: I think that in the student performance data set we will see that students whose parents have higher education will have higher performance across the board.
The model that I will use for this data set is most likely something that works well with continuous data, for example Linear Regression
