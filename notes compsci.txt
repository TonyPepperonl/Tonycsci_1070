Cd is change directory which allows you to change your user

Ls shows the files that are in your user 

Flow Control
- Controls how you move through a file or a particular type of data

4 options
- if...elif...else, if this then this
if a equals b, return "they are equal", If a greater than b "a is greater" and if b is greater than a, 
return "b is greater


- for, looping, having multiple things do something until something happens


- while, while this is true do this


- Range, the range of a list which lets you go through every item

------------------------------

- Loops are flow control. Changes how code executes iteratively, how data moves through the application

== is comparing whereas = is setting something equal to something else
ex.
a = 3
b = 9

if a == b:
    print("they are equal")
elif a>b:
    print("a is greater")
elif b>a:
    print("b is greater")

----------------------------

While loops
- repeatedly test an expression and continue to run whatever is in the loop 
until a stopping condition is met
ex.
x = 3
while x < 10:
    print(x)
    x += 1

-----------------------------------

For loops

ex. 
cats = ["Dexter","Grumpy", "Pete", "Dotty", "Fluffy"]
for cat in cats:
    print(cat)

--------------------------------------

Range
- (Start, stop [, step])
stop is exclusive, so its not included

for r in range(1,10+1,2):
    print(r)

---------------------------
Function
- if we want our code to be reusable, we use a function
- any variables we use in the function need to be passed in or defined 
inside the function itself
ex. 
def comparision(a,b):
        if a == b:
            return"they are equal"
        elif a>b:
            return"a is greater"
        elif b>a:
            return"b is greater" 
comparision(2,7)

-------------------------------------------------

Classes

Three types
-class methods, static methods, and instance methods

Class Method: Can modify calss state, cannot modify object state, Used for factory functions
Static Method: Cannot access class state, Cannot access object state, Can Modify object state
Instance method: Can modify class state, Can modify object state

- Factory Functions seperate the process of creating an object from the code that depends on the
interface of the object
- Utility functions handle logic and checks (see if person on the website is over 18, see if inputs meet
particular requirements,etc)
